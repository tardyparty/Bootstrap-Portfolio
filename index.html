            <p>I have spent the last 3 years traveling the country for a mapping startup called Live XYZ. Within three months of being hired as a contractor, 
                I mapped the entire city of Miami by myself and was then promoted to a full-time salaried position. <br>
                After moving to Headquarters in New York City, I helped interview, hire, train and manage 15 employees using a 30-day training program that I 
                developed from scratch. I created various initiatives and experiments on my own time to test new operational methods and to discover ways to 
                improve my teams efficiency, accuracy, and overall performance. <br>
                My passion is to help grow an aggressive Startup's operations nationwide. <br>
